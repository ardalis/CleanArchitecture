# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## What is an Architecture Decision Record (ADR)?
An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) documents significant architecture decisions made throughout a project, capturing the context, rationale, and consequences of each decision. This promotes transparency and provides a historical reference for future design considerations.

## Purpose of ADRs
- **Knowledge Management**: Consolidates architectural knowledge and decisions.
- **Collaboration**: Enhances team communication by documenting discussions and outcomes.
- **Clarity**: Provides clear reasoning behind design choices, making it easier for new team members to understand past decisions.

## Best Practices for Writing ADRs
1. **Be Specific**: Each ADR should address a single architectural decision. Avoid conflating multiple decisions into one record.
2. **Document Context**: Clearly explain the projectâ€™s context and relevant considerations that influenced the decision. Include team dynamics and priorities.
3. **Rationale and Consequences**: Describe the reasons for the decision, including pros and cons, and outline the implications of the decision for the project and 

future architecture.
4. **Immutable Records**: Once an ADR is created, avoid altering it. Instead, create a new ADR to reflect any changes or updates.
5. **Timestamp Entries**: Include timestamps to track when each decision was made, especially for aspects that may evolve over time (e.g., costs, schedules).
6. **Use Templates**: Utilize established templates for consistency and completeness in documenting ADRs.

## Versioning ADRs
- **Track Changes**: Each time an ADR is updated or a new version is created, increment the version number (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.) to reflect changes clearly.
- **Document Changes**: Include a "Changelog" section in the ADR to summarize what has changed in each version. This can include updates to the rationale, context, or decision consequences.
- **Maintain Clarity**: Ensure the latest version is easily accessible while keeping older versions for reference. You might consider using a version control system (e.g., Git) to manage this effectively.

## How to Start Using ADRs
1. **Identify Decisions**: Collaborate with your team to identify significant architecture decisions that need documentation.
2. **Select a Tool**: Choose a tool for documenting ADRs (e.g., markdown files in a Git repository, Google Docs, project management tools).
3. **Create ADRs**: For each decision, create an ADR file in the `adr` directory, following naming conventions (e.g., `choose-database.md`).

## File Name Conventions
- Use a present tense imperative verb phrase.
- Separate words with lowercase letters and dashes.
- Use `.md` extension for markdown formatting.

## Templates
Refer to the following templates for structuring your ADRs:
- [Decision record template by Michael Nygard](https://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
- [Decision record template by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman](https://github.com/adr/adr)
- [MADR project templates](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

## Teamwork Advice for ADRs
- Foster a culture of collaborative decision-making and ensure ADRs are seen as valuable tools rather than bureaucratic requirements.
- Consider using the term "decisions" instead of "ADRs" to encourage engagement.
- Maintain living documents by updating existing ADRs with new information rather than rewriting them.

By following these guidelines, your team can effectively leverage ADRs to enhance architectural decision-making and project transparency while keeping a clear version history of all architectural decisions.
