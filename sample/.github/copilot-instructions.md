## Architecture Overview

- Follows Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
- **Core** project contains domain models, value objects, and repository interfaces.
- **UseCases** project contains application logic, commands, queries, and handlers.
- **Infrastructure** project implements data access and external services.
- **Web** project exposes API endpoints using FastEndpoints.

**Dependency Flow:**  
`Core` ← `UseCases` ← `Infrastructure`  
`Core` ← `UseCases` ← `Web`  
_Core must never depend on outer layers._

---

## Project Structure

- **Core**: Domain entities, aggregates, value objects, domain events, repository interfaces.
- **UseCases**: CQRS handlers (commands/queries), MediatR, application logic.
- **Infrastructure**: EF Core, external services, repository implementations.
- **Web**: FastEndpoints API, request/response/validator classes, REPR pattern.

---

## Development Patterns

- **CQRS**: Use commands for mutations and queries for reads.
- **MediatR**: All use case handlers implement MediatR interfaces.
- **Repository Pattern**: Use repository interfaces from Core, implemented in Infrastructure.
- **Value Objects**: Use for domain concepts (e.g., `ProjectName`, `ContributorId`).
- **Domain Events**: Use for cross-aggregate communication.

---

## Use Case Guidelines

- **Inputs/Outputs**: Use Value Objects (`ProjectName`, `ContributorId`) for use case command/query parameters and return types. Use value objects internally within the domain. Translate from primitives in the endpoints.
- **Validation**: Validate at API and use case boundaries; enforce business invariants in the domain.
- **Error Handling**: Use `Ardalis.Result<T>` for use case results and error propagation.
- **Defensive Coding**: Validate commands/queries in handlers; assume pre-validated input in domain. Use `Ardalis.GuardClauses` to defend against invalid states in the domain.

---

## API Endpoint Conventions

- One endpoint per file (e.g., `Create.cs`, `Update.cs`).
- Separate files for request, response, and validator (e.g., `Create.CreateRequest.cs`, `Create.CreateResponse.cs`, `Create.CreateValidator.cs`).
- Endpoints inherit from `Endpoint<TRequest, TResponse>`.
- Use REPR (Request/Endpoint/Processor/Response) pattern.

---

## Validation Strategy

- **API Level**: Use FluentValidation for request DTOs.
- **Use Case Level**: Validate commands/queries in handlers or behaviors.
- **Domain Level**: Throw exceptions for business rule violations using guard clauses (e.g., `Ardalis.GuardClauses`).)

---

## Testing

- **UnitTests**: Test domain logic and use cases.
- **IntegrationTests**: Test infrastructure and database interactions.
- **FunctionalTests**: Test API endpoints using subcutaneous testing.

---

## File & Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for files, classes, and methods.
- Organize files by feature (e.g., `Contributors/Create.cs`, `Projects/Create.cs`).
- Place request, response, and validator files alongside their endpoint.
- Do not use hyphens in project or file names.
- Test classes are named for the class and method being tested. Examples: `ProjectAddItem` or `CreateContributorHandlerHandle`.
- Test methods are named such that the class name and method name form a sentence describing the test. (e.g. `ReturnsItemGivenValidInputs()` or `ThrowsExceptionGivenNegativeInput()`)

---

## Common Gotchas

- Do not allow Core to reference UseCases, Infrastructure, or Web.
- Use absolute paths for EF Core migration commands.
